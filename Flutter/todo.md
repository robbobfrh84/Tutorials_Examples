### Where I left off
-  I got everything setup. BUT haven't yet tested it out with using VS Code yet. The extention for VS CODE is installed, just not yet tested.
- SO! need to move onto "test drive": https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/test-drive

### To Do âœ… ðŸŸ¡
- âœ… `getting_started.md`
- ðŸŸ¡ âœ… (just haven't tested it yet) Setup for VS Code Development
- Create `test_drive.md` and DO it!
- Create `write_your_first_app.md` and DO it!

----
# Raw Notes
- See `getting_started.md` where I went through and setup the dev env locally.
- However, I didn't go into setting up for testing on actual phones / devices. I think I'll need to set up a developer account ($99/yr) If I wanna do that.
