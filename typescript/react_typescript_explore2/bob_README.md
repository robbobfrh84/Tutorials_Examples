### ðŸ¤“ Bob, this is kinda just a... test and use/add as needed kinda thing ;)

Things to add:
- // const API = async (endPoint: string, setMoviesResult: Dispatch<SetStateAction<Array<moviesResultProps>>>) => {
- We didn't do it like this. but i wanna do an example that shows how you can have hook events with arrays of objects this way, but allso with just <any>

type vs interfaces: 
- One major difference between type aliases vs interfaces are that interfaces 
are open and type aliases are closed. This means you can extend an interface 
by declaring it a second time.In the other case a type cannot be changed outside 
of its declaration.
