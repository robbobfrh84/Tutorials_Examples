# Google Apps Scripts Guides and Examples
The folders found here all give basic Google Apps Scripts examples, and provide the code to replicate the process on your own.

# Tweets
Several of the examples have links to tweets where useful discussions may take place about the example, the process or the futher questions. Feel free to reach out to me(@bobmain49) on twitter. Or, here on github!
