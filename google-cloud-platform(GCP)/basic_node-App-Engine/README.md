# NodeJS App Engine Guide

NOTE: This tutorial is done with a MAC, but other OS systems softwares needed are included in the links. Mac Terminal command are similar to "$git bash" for windows.
- Please feel free to make contributions to this file/repo if you'd like to make this guide better for other developers.

- NOTE that I've added a little extra code beyond the basic "hello, World".

### Pre-work:

To complete this walkthrough. You will need a gmail account, as well as activating your developer account at `console.cloud.google.com`. Also, You'll need to sign up for the free trail version to use the Google Cloud Platform. Yes, that means you'll need to put in a debt/credit cardðŸ˜•. Nothing in this tutorial should trigger your account to be charged ("i doubt"). But in case it does google's free trial gives you $300 of free credit for 12 months, in case you do find yourself with some unwanted/unknown traffic!

### Install Google Cloud SDK Software
Google Cloud SDK: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/#install_the_latest_cloud_tools_version_cloudsdk_current_version
 - Unzip file. Put folder in permanent place
    - I put mine in `Documents`
  - In Terminal: $`cd` to folder you unzipped your folder to and run...
  - $`./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh` > double check directory here if not working.
    - Say $`y` to questions and note path info.
  - Then, you'll need to restart Terminal to take effect
  - Test it works by running $`gcloud info`
  - Then, $`cd` back to the folder you saved the unzipped folder before.
  - Now, initiate the SDK to your google profile by running $`./google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud init`
  - follow the link to log into your google account.

### Create and Configue Project
Create a new project or select a project you've already created.
  - NOTE: It may use one of the weird auto-generated names in addition to the name you created for it so select your project in the console.cloud.google.com to find out what it is.
Go to "console.cloud.google.com" Select the project you created:
  - Enable Cloud Build: Search "cloud build" and select "enable".
  - Enable Billing: click menu icon (top-left). And select billing.
    - Select enable billing for this project.

### Demo code Locally
- If needed, here's clone this code to test with:
  - $`git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/nodejs-docs-samples`
  - $`cd nodejs-docs-samples/appengine/hello-world/standard`
  - $`npm install`
  - $`npm start`
  - visit : "http://localhost:8080"

### Deploy:
- $`gcloud app deploy`
  - Continue by selecting 'y' to confirm.
  - may need to also select region
- If successful: try $`gcloud app browse` to open url in chrome.

# The Skinny guide / Summery.
- Create project
- Enable billing for project
- Add cloud build api
- $`gcloud app deploy`
